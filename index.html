          <div class="sectionContent">
            <p>As a software developer, I love progressing the code, ideas and team culture. I like to keep my skills
              broad, and love working in multiple programming languages. I consider
              myself an all-round software engineer, as I like and tend to be able to adjust to the technical stack the
              project requires.</p>
            <p>As a leader I am a strong advocate for team culture and collaboration. I believe in a flat hierarchy and a
              high level of cross-team and discipline collaboration with each discipline having a voice. I am confident in
              public speaking and teaching, with extensive experience conducting technical and cultural interviews both
              in Australia and remotely with international teams.</p>
            <p>I have a large number of hobbies and interests, including but not limited to 3D printing, music
              production, running, hiking, and skydiving. I am currently restoring a 1974 VW Kombi campervan.
              I am enjoying learning each step of the way and restoring it to its former glory.

              <p>In my role as Group Engineering Manager, I drove consistency, autonomy, and delivery capability
                across multiple engineering teams. I worked to embed a culture of proactive ownership, constructive
                feedback, and cross-functional collaboration.</p>
              <p>I mentored Engineering Managers and engineers, ensuring alignment between execution and company vision.
                Even at my position, when possible, I was still hands-on in
                feature development, API and database design, and production issue resolution. Helping my team in 
                understanding the needs of the business and the requirements of the features and systems we were
                building and improving.</p>
              <p>I led engagement with clinical, compliance, and executive leaders—using technical insight and domain expertise
                to shape both the roadmap and the broader product strategy.</p>
              <p>I conducted technical and cultural interviews for new hires within the engineering, product and
                delivery teams, ensuring we were hiring the right people for the right roles.</p>

              <p>As an Engineering Manager I led a collaborative and high-performing engineering team known as “The Quokkas”.
                I maintained hands-on involvement in feature development, API and database design, and production issue
                resolution.</p>
              <p>I introduced and facilitated agile ceremonies, including retrospectives, sprint planning, pair
                programming, and code reviews.
                I created an epic ownership model to encourage autonomy, accountability, and skill rotation. </p>
              <p>I worked closely with clinical, compliance, and business stakeholders to ensure technical solutions met
                regulatory and operational needs.</p>

              <p>I worked on delivering high-quality software solutions while tackling complex technical challenges. Our

              <p class="subDetails">April 2022 - Present</p>
              <p>When given the opportunity to become an iOS developer, I jumped at the chance to learn more about the
                mobile and native app space. I started this role with no previous native development experience.
                As we used a server-driven architecture, the knowledge I gained through working on the SDUI back-end API
                helped greatly in understanding the architecture of our native app space. </p>
              <p>
                During this time I have ramped-up and interviewed new iOS developers onto our architecture and iOS
                development processes.

              <p class="subDetails">March 2020 - Present</p>
              <p>In this role, I am primarily a back-end Kotlin developer; however, I work to help maintain a variety of
                both back and front-end systems.</p>
              <p>One of my most notable projects includes being part of the team migrating a high traffic application in
                Expedia from a client sided legacy system, to an API first server-driven UI architecture. The stack we
                used
                for this was Kotlin, GraphQL interfacing with a gRPC lower layer.</p>
              <p>In this project I was responsible for all aspects of the API; including but not limited to designing UI
                data schema (and taking it from schema to code) and ensuring all clients (web, mobile web,
                native iOS/Android) agreed on a single schema. This ensured there was no downtime between implementation
                and/or changes.</p>

                during this time was supporting building and maintaining a react PWA with a node middle-layer API.</p>
              <p>I ran a community sync meeting of React developers spread across multiple time zones, to share ideas,
