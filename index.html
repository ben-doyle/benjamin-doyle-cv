          <div class="sectionContent">
            <p>As a Software developer, I love progressing the code, ideas and team culture. I like to keep my skills
              broad, and love working in multiple programming languages. I consider
              myself an all-round software engineer, as I like and tend to be able to adjust to the technical stack the
              project requires.</p>
            <p>As a leader I am a strong advocate for team culture and collaboration. I believe in a flat hierarchy and a
              high level of cross-team and discipline collaboration with each discipline having a voice. I am confident in
              public speaking and teaching, with extensive experience conducting technical and cultural interviews both
              in Australia and remotely with international teams.</p>
            <p>I have a large amount of hobbies and interests, including but not limited to 3D printing, music
              production, running, hiking, and skydiving. I am currently restoring a 1974 VW Kombi campervan, choosing
              a manual passion to have a contrast to the digital world. It is the largest project I have undertaken and
              I am enjoying learning each step of the way and restoring it to its former glory.

              <p class="subDetails">March 2025 - Present</p>
              <p>As a Group Engineering Manager, my priority is to ensure every team has the support to deliver quality
                solutions. I always strive to build a culture where innovation is celebrated, feedback is valued, and
                there is a high level of cross-team and discipline collaboration.</p>
              <p>I support each team's Engineering Manager and a cross-functional group of engineers who take the
                initiative, solve problems, and drive results. My role is to guide and empower them, providing the
                structure and vision they need to flourish and succeed.</p>
              <p>In this expanded role, I drive strategic partnerships across clinical, compliance, and executive
                leadership teams, influencing organizational priorities and technical roadmaps. I leverage my deep
                domain expertise to translate complex business requirements into actionable engineering strategies.</p>

              <p class="subDetails">September 2023 - March 2025</p>
              <p>As an Engineering Manager I lead a highly cohesive and collaborative team of talented developers. The
                team, affectionately known as the "Quokkas", is a tight-knit group of developers who are passionate
                about their work and committed to delivering high-quality solutions.</p>
              <p>We focus on delivering projects efficiently and on time, without losing sight of the importance of team
                cohesion and a supportive work environment. I encourage and support my team to be empowered and take
                ownership of their work and to be proactive in finding solutions to problems.</p>
              <p>A large part of this role required building and maintaining relationships with clinical, compliance,
                and business stakeholders. I was able to use my experience in the role to help guide the team in
                understanding the needs of the business and the requirements of the features and systems we were
                building and improving.</p>

              <p>I worked on delivering high-quality software solutions while tackling complex technical challenges. Our
                largest challenges were around improving the code from where it was at, to more extensible and
                maintainable code able to handle the growing number of patients and roles of the business</p>
              <p>I collaborated closely with my team, contributing to major projects and ensuring our systems ran
                smoothly. </p>

              <p class="subDetails">April 2022 - Present</p>
              <p>When given the opportunity to become an iOS developer I jumped at the chance to learn more about the
                mobile and native app space. I started this role with no previous native development experience.
                As we used a server-driven architecture, the knowledge I gained through working on the SDUI back-end API
                helped greatly in understanding the architecture of our native app space. </p>
              <p>
                During this time I have to ramped-up and interviewed new iOS developers onto our architecture and iOS
                development processes. I enjoy iOS development quite a lot, but I still enjoy and seek out opportunities
                to work up and down the techical stack. I have recently started a rotation to another team as an iOS
                developer with back-end experience.

              <p class="subDetails">March 2020 - Present</p>
              <p>In this role, I am primarily a back-end Kotlin developer, however, I work to help maintain a variety of
                both back and front-end systems.</p>
              <p>One of my most notable projects includes being part of the team migrating a high traffic application in
                Expedia from a client sided legacy system, to an API first server-driven UI architecture. The stack we
                used
                for this was Kotlin, GraphQL interfacing with a gRPC lower layer.</p>
              <p>In this project I was responsible for all aspects of the API; including but not limited to designing UI
                data schema (and taking it from schema to code) and ensuring all clients (web, mobile web,
                native iOS/Android) agreed on a single schema. This ensuring there was no downtime between implmentation
                and/or changes.</p>

              <p>I ran a community sync meeting of React developers spread in multiple timezones, to share ideas,
